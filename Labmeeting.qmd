## Rationale

As scientists, we spend a **lot** of time coding and writing.

![](data_analysis/timespent.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

Unfortunately, both activities involve repetitive behaviors and suboptimal routines...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, we might...

::: incremental
-   Duplicate our manuscript many times during co-edition
-   Struggle with references and bibliographies
-   Spend hours (days) reformating papers for resubmissions
-   Paste many variants of a figure in our presentation/report
-   Spend way to much title aligning items on Powerpoint
-   Feel like it is a big effort to put together a few slides or a report to describe our results
-   Have no idea of how we could participate or animate large-scale collaborations ! ü§™
:::

## Time wasted reduces your happiness

And this is particularly true when it comes with collaborating with our peers.

## What prevents us from collaborating more smoothly?

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   Endless multiplication of communication channels (Mattermost üòá)

-   Data and code on local computers

-   Suboptimal coding practices (no virtual envs, no version control, absolute paths)

-   Lack of knowledge regarding others interests, skills and activities

-   Dependence upon Google Docs is increasingly problematic

    -   And Google Docs is not even great

-   Unnecessary differences in software use.

-   ...?

## A (tiny) reason to hope!

![](data_analysis/refManagement.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

Most Cophy-makers already use Zotero or are willing to change. Users of Latex will be fine anyways.

## A (bigger) reason to worry?

It seems that Cophy-makers use a **huge** diversity of IDE, and that we are still a minority to use Git-based version control.

## Towards a straightforward solution

Correlation does not imply causation, but those who are still not using Git may still need to install Visual Studio Code.

# Tutorial!

Be reassured: following it won't break your computer, it won't require much space and it is safe.

## Visual Studio Code

[Click here for the main installer](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and then get the next three extension:

-   [Click here to get SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) capability (connect **directly** to the cluster, or any server, via SSH!)
-   [Click here to get Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) real-time collaboration tool (great to debug and even write together)
-   [Click here to get a web browser](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Phu1237.vs-browser) inside VScode (**to follow the rest of this presentation** and more!)

[If you're waiting, you can get more extensions: [GitGraph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph) (to help dealing with messy Git), [Rainbow CSV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv) (to help reading CSVs), [Jupyter](#0)]{style="font-size:80%"}

## Wait, how is this going to help with writing?

Because it writing in VS Code is actually possible, and amazing, thanks to the [Markdow](https://www.markdownguide.org/) syntax combined with another **really powerful** tool, **Quarto**. ::: {.incremental style="font-size: 80%;"} - **Huge** improvement in the accessibility of Markdown thanks to a Word-like editor.

-   **Amazing** reference management logics (flawless integration with Zotero, Pubmed, Crossref, fromDOI, etc.)

-   Possibility to write: code, articles, books, websites and.. simple presentations like this one! ::: [Click here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) to get Quarto itself and [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto) to get the VScode extension.

## Final step before discovering Quarto

Now, we'll just need to make sure that everyone has:

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

-   [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (optional but useful if you have a Github account)

Once it's done, just close and restart.

## Let's experiment with our collaboration pipeline

Since we are on the CRNL network, we can easily connect to the cluster using SSH.

To do so, just click the bottom left button of VS code

![](img/sshButton.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

Choose "Connect to host" and enter:

`ssh prenom.nom@10.69.168.62`

Then enter your CRNL credentials (same as those who get you in the wiki!)
